## Abstract

Global tipping points in forest wildfires

Saravia L. A.,  Ben Bond-Lamberty, Samir Suweis, Solé R. 

Fire is one of the most important disturbances of the earth-system, shaping the biodiversity of ecosystems and particularly forests. Anthropogenic drivers such as climatic change and other human activities could produce potentially abrupt changes in fire regimes, potentially triggering more profound transformations like the transition from forests to savannah, grasslands or desert ecosystems. Large biodiversity loss could be produced if these transitions occur. Two of the more important factors influencing fires are temperature and precipitation, and climatic change could cause conditions that enhance fire ignition and spread, which in turn will produce more extensive, intense, and frequent fires. Here we analyze the changes in fire regimes at subcontinental scales, including in regions defined as tipping elements of the earth system. We propose a unified fire model that includes the most basic characteristics needed to reproduce the observed fire dynamics in these regions. Considering IPCC climate projections for the 21st century, we evaluate the possible changes in these fire regimes and the expected changes in global forests.

@NatureEcoEvo2020 Biodiversity in flames

Fires burn and spread because of current weather conditions and because of the quantity, distribution and dryness of fuel, which are determined by interactions between climate and forest ecology. While limited fires can have positive consequences for biodiversity, the effect of those at the scale currently being experienced is catastrophic, both for species and for ecosystems. This season has seen record-breaking temperatures in eastern Australia, which provide the conditions for fire ignition and spread. There is no doubt that such conditions will become more frequent and that new records will soon be set, and that this is the result of anthropogenic climate change.

One should expect considerably higher risks by the end of the century if the warming surpasses certain limits. The change in the amount of precipitation in summer will not offset the temperature increase, which will accelerate water stress for trees on the larger part of Russia. In this case, the most probable scenario for boreal forests would consist in the nonlinear response of forest ecosystems, which may lead to the creation of new ecosystems and the disappearance of species with limited adaptation capacity. According to the models and expert assessments, the regional warming by 6–7°C will mean the critical limits in functioning of boreal forest ecosystems will be reached. If these limits are surpassed, this will result in a massive dieback of trees. If the threshold values of resilience are overpassed, this process will be rather quick and a considerable transformation of boreal forests may take place in 50 years.

In Australia, it is difficult to disaggregate the influences of climate change from the effects of the cessation of >45,000 years of Aboriginal hunter-gatherer fire management following European colonization in the early nineteenth century 86,87 . However, the effect of climate change is becoming apparent in the increasing numbers of extreme fire events 24,88,8Most recently, a globally anomalous 2019–2020 fire season in Australia burned over 5 million ha of Eucalyptus forests 93 and has been linked with anthropogenic climate change 93,94 . 

Moreover, tropical deforestation fires have remained relatively constant over the last 30 years after increasing during the 1980s in line with increased deforestation 99,100 , despite climate change. Instead, an important feature of tropical deforestation fires is the strong interannual variation in step with drought cycles, such as those caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation 101,102 (Fig. 3i,j) . 


Landscape-wide conversions from slow-growing, infrequently burned forests to frequently burned grassland and shrublands are possible (Fig. 5) , which depletes soil carbon stores, as in regrowth forests in the conifer forests in the western USA 133 and in Indonesia 134 . This feedback process is most likely self-correcting because fire regimes will shift from being flammability-limited to fuel-limited with increasing reduced productivity 40,42,133

The use of ‘planetary-scale’ tipping point suggests to us and to Brook et al. [2] synchronous or near-synchronous tipping on a global scale. Hughes et al. [3] concede this ‘is very unlikely’ for the terrestrial biosphere, yet they persevere with the term when describing nonsynchronous cascades of smaller-scale tipping points that ultimately add up to global effects. Here, the critical uncertainty is whether the causal coupling between different tipping events is of the sign and strength necessary to produce a global tipping cascade (e.g., Figure 1, main text @Miller2019

@Grimm2012 Pattern-oriented modelling: a “multi-scope” for predictive systems ecology. 

Statistical physicists have used very abstract models to explain this distribution, linking it to the theory of ‘self-organized criticality’ (SOC): systems can organize themselves into a state characterized by self-similarity and, hence, a power law in the size frequency distribution of disturbance events. The classical model in this field includes a grid of cells that can be empty or contain a tree [41]. Cells are subject to lightning strikes which, if they hit a tree, spark a fire. Fire spreads deterministically to neighbouring cells with trees and destroys the trees. New trees emerge stochastically on empty grid cells. In contrast, generic wildfire models from ecology assume that fire spread is stochastic, that the flammability of a grid cell depends on the time since the cell burn the last time, and that succession and, hence, the local increase of flammability is deterministic [42,43].

Thus, these two types of model seem completely different: deterministic fires and stochastic regrowth of vegetation in the physicists’ model, stochastic fires and deterministic regrowth in the ecologists’ models. The advantage of the physicists’ model is that many of its features can be deduced analytically, whereas the
patterns is a ‘memory effect’: flammability increases with the time since a site last burned. In particular, Ratz [42] showed that his model not only reproduces the key power-law pattern, but also two additional patterns: the typical size and shape of unburned ‘forest islands’ within burnt areas, and a hump-shaped relationship between disturbance intensity (average annual area burned) and diversity of successional stages (figure 2).

Zinck & Grimm showed that these two additional patterns are also produced by the physicists’ model if grid cells represent entire tree stands of several hectares instead of individual trees [35,44]. They also showed that the key process for reproducing all three patterns is a ‘memory effect’: flammability increases
with the time since a site last burned. Interestingly, this unified model did not reproduce a fourth pattern: that the slope of fire size distributions observed in different ecoregions varies between -1.9 and -1.3. The unified model instead consistently produces a slope of -1.5. This failure indicated that the true generative mechanisms underlying wildfire regimes were not yet fully captured.


In subsequent work, Zinck et al. [45] found that the fire models’ assumption that fire spread is controlled only by fuel availability produces the unrealistic results. Fire spread is also affected by soil moisture, topography, species composition and other regional factors. A parameter for average spread success controls the slope of fire size distributions and the qualitative characteristics of fire regimes, and even separates two quantitatively and qualitatively distinct fire regimes. Thus, environmental changes can induce a sudden change in the characteristics of a forest system, a result that cannot be produced by the SOC models.

Fire spread is not just a function of weather, but also of topography, fuel load, types
and spatial arrangement, and active suppression. Therefore, the main fire spread simulation
models for everyday fire management require an enormous amount of site-specific informa-
tion (Perry 1998). Such models have been used in the context of climate change forecasting
(Fried et al. 2004). However, the spatial and temporal scale involved in this field frequently
makes this approach impractical, as (i) the computational effort is overwhelming, (ii) the
required local information is not available in large areas of the globe, and (iii) local details
may readily change over time. Therefore, many published reports on the effect of climate
change on wildland fire give forecasts of the evolution of some given atmospheric variables
or combinations of atmospheric variables that are particularly relevant to fire spread, but do
not translate these variables into fire features (Stocks et al. 1998; Flannigan et al. 1998, 2000;
Brown et al. 2004).

One advantage of minimal models, due to their level of
abstraction, is that they may apply across different systems,
and this leads us to the development of the model we

@Furlaud2021 - Bioclimatic drivers of fire severity across the Australian geographical range of giant Eucalyptus forests


Overall, our results indicate that climatic constraints on fire weather and fuel availability, not fuel load, are the key drivers of fire severity in these forests, which has been the general consensus on TWEF (Cawson et al., 2020).

While combustion of the live understorey is a key predictor of fire severity, the flammability of these live plants is primarily governed by fuel moisture and hence climate (Nolan et al., 2016). Extrinsic factors (such as climate and fire weather) have been well documented to play a dominant role in determining fire severity when compared to intrinsic factors (such as fuel load and arrangement), both in TWEF (Bowman et al., 2016) and in Eucalyptus forests more broadly (Penman et al., 2013; Price & Bradstock, 2011). This suggests these systems are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and given an increased likelihood of high-severity fire in a warming climate, need to be managed to reduce this likelihood and make these forests more resilient. This can be achieved by greater recognition of the ecological role of low-severity fires in these ecosystems.

The PMB paradigm is based on the assumption that the biotas of fire-prone biomes have finely tuned responses to a wide range of specific fire regimes. This assumption has recently been challenged on the basis that much variation in fire regimes appears to have no ecological significance; indeed, in highly fire-prone ecosystems, the biota is so resilient that differences are often only evident between strongly contrasting regimes (Parr & Andersen 2006; Davies et al. 2012). It has been suggested that the level of pyrodiversity required to maintain biodiversity might actually be very low (Andersen et al. 2005).

Surface tropical fires are expected to kill mostly small‐ and medium‐
sized trees, because the larger, thicker barked individuals can avoid
heat‐related damage to cambium cells during fires (Brando et al.,
2012). Although delayed postfire mortality of large trees has been
observed across the tropics, the mechanisms driving this process
remain unclear (Barlow et al., 2003). In our study, the persistent
postfire mortality of large trees may have been associated with their
increased vulnerability to windstorms. 

Specifically, the fires weak‐ 
ened trunks and increased crown exposure of large trees to strong 
winds that impacted the experimental forest (Silvério et al., 2019). 
This postfire disturbance caused greater losses in canopy cover and 
biomass in areas impacted by our experimental fires. The observed 
rapid growth of resprouts and saplings was expected to partially re‐ 
store forest structure (Chazdon et al., 2007), but ABG reached its 
lowest levels 7 years after the experimental fires had ended, particu‐ 
larly along the forest edges. Our results suggest that fragmentation 
of tropical forests—and the associated increase in forest edges— 
could dramatically increase the negative impacts of fires and lead 
to persistent losses of biomass (Silva et al., 2018). This is particularly 
true where fires co‐occur with extreme droughts that can further 
increase fire intensity and fire‐related tree mortality by triggering 
accumulation and desiccation of fuels (Aragão et al., 2008). 
A permanent transition to a new, derived‐savanna state in this 
ecotone would require persistence of grass cover and a more open 
canopy. While grasses could persist along the forest edges due to
delayed postfire tree mortality (Higgins, Bond, & Trollope, 2000),
we instead observed widespread postfire resprouting of woody
vegetation—including in areas that had been previously covered by
grasses. However, the total area occupied by grasses did not de‐
crease, because grasses invaded new areas between 2012 and 2015.
Furthermore, we found no major replacement of C4 by C3 species,
a process expected to occur as light in the understory of the burned
plots became scarce. Instead, light‐demanding African C4 grasses
became more abundant, particularly where fires in previous years
had been more intense and severe, and where the blowdown event
had topkilled more trees (e.g., B3yr). The delayed tree mortality
drove much of this process by increasing light and probably water
availability as canopy cover decreased. Another likely driver was
the greater capacity of African grasses to produce, germinate, and
disperse seeds compared with the Cerrado native grasses (Higgins
et al., 2000). These results raise the question of whether the edge of

Modeling work—based largely on simple models of tree populations interacting with mean-field approximations of critical behaviors in fire spread—suggests that the threshold response of fire spread to fuel-layer continuity could provide a plausible mechanism for maintaining the bistability of savanna and forest (Beckage and Ellingwood 2008; Beckage et al. 2009; Staver et al. 2011a; Staver and Levin 2012). Although empirically well supported (Archibald et al. 2009; Pueyo and Alen- castro Graa 2010), these modeling efforts have largely neglected to explicitly take into account the spatial dynamics of fire spread. This omission of the spatial dynamics of fire spread and of tree demography is problematic for two main reasons. Firstly, mean-field models cannot address the possibility, clearly recognized in the theoretical literature, that spatial dynamics may qualitatively change the stability characteristics of dynamical systems (Durrett and Levin 1994; Levin and Durrett 1996). Secondly, they can provide few insights into how local, spatial interactions mechanistically give rise to emergent patterns in fire spread (Archibald et al. 2009; Pueyo and Alencastro Graa 2010) and how these determine tree demographic responses to fire (Staver and Levin 2012). Percolation (Grimmett 1999) and, more generally, nearest-neighbor infection models (Archibald et al. 2012) make useful predictions about the threshold responses of fire regimes to fuel layer connectivity that emerge both locally and at the continental scale (Archibald et al. 2009; Pueyo and Alencastro Graa 2010; Staver et al. 2011a,b). However, although fire spread modeling in static landscapes can be fairly sophisticated (Sullivan 2009; Zinck and Grimm 2009), fully understanding the role of fire as an ecological process that emerges from and determines grass and tree cover in savanna remains an ongoing challenge.


Previous analytical models have tended to assume that, if fire spreads in a landscape, it affects the entire landscape, when in fact fire only affects those areas where it can propagate. This may lead to significant spatial structure in landscapes (Hochberg et al. 1994)

Approximately 38% of the burned forest was subsequently deforested, which represents 19% of the total area deforested during the period of analysis (Table 3, Fig. 7B). Although this rate was higher for the forest areas that were burned twice (45%), it was similar to the areas that burned three or four times during this period (averages of 41% and 35%, respectively), while decreasing in the forest areas that burned more than ﬁve times (,20%; Table 2). These results suggest a weak relation-
ship between ﬁre frequency and the likelihood of a forest being cleared in this region.

In 2010, the Amazon experienced another drought (36), with widespread understory forest fires that affected 5.4% of the Xingu region (Fig. S10). These extensive fires occurred even as deforestation declined (Table S2), suggesting that weather may have overwhelmed the expected inhibitory effect (on forest fires) of reducing the fire ignition sources that often accompany deforestation.

These feedbacks, as well as potential additional carbon losses due to climate-induced
7 fire feedback are not routinely included in Earth System models. {Box 5.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.7, 5.4.8, Box TS.9}


Additional ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully
included in climate models, such as CO2 and CH4 fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw and wildfires,
would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere (high confidence).
