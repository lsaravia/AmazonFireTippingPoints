Global tipping points in forest wildfires

Saravia L. A.,  Ben Bond-Lamberty, Samir Suweis, Solé R. 

Fire is one of the most important disturbances of the earth-system, shaping the biodiversity of ecosystems and particularly forests. Anthropogenic drivers such as climatic change and other human activities could produce potentially abrupt changes in fire regimes, potentially triggering more profound transformations like the transition from forests to savannah, grasslands or desert ecosystems. Large biodiversity loss could be produced if these transitions occur. Two of the more important factors influencing fires are temperature and precipitation, and climatic change could cause conditions that enhance fire ignition and spread, which in turn will produce more extensive, intense, and frequent fires. Here we analyze the changes in fire regimes at subcontinental scales, including in regions defined as tipping elements of the earth system. We propose a unified fire model that includes the most basic characteristics needed to reproduce the observed fire dynamics in these regions. Considering IPCC climate projections for the 21st century, we evaluate the possible changes in these fire regimes and the expected changes in global forests.

Fires burn and spread because of current weather conditions and because of the quantity, distribution and dryness of fuel, which are determined by interactions between climate and forest ecology. While limited fires can have positive consequences for biodiversity, the effect of those at the scale currently being experienced is catastrophic, both for species and for ecosystems. This season has seen record-breaking temperatures in eastern Australia, which provide the conditions for fire ignition and spread. There is no doubt that such conditions will become more frequent and that new records will soon be set, and that this is the result of anthropogenic climate change.

One should expect considerably higher risks by the end of the century if the warming surpasses certain limits. The change in the amount of precipitation in summer will not offset the temperature increase, which will accelerate water stress for trees on the larger part of Russia. In this case, the most probable scenario for boreal forests would consist in the nonlinear response of forest ecosystems, which may lead to the creation of new ecosystems and the disappearance of species with limited adaptation capacity. According to the models and expert assessments, the regional warming by 6–7°C will mean the critical limits in functioning of boreal forest ecosystems will be reached. If these limits are surpassed, this will result in a massive dieback of trees. If the threshold values of resilience are overpassed, this process will be rather quick and a considerable transformation of boreal forests may take place in 50 years.

In Australia, it is difficult to disaggregate the influences of climate change from the effects of the cessation of >45,000 years of Aboriginal hunter-gatherer fire management following European colonization in the early nineteenth century 86,87 . However, the effect of climate change is becoming apparent in the increasing numbers of extreme fire events 24,88,8Most recently, a globally anomalous 2019–2020 fire season in Australia burned over 5 million ha of Eucalyptus forests 93 and has been linked with anthropogenic climate change 93,94 . 

Moreover, tropical deforestation fires have remained relatively constant over the last 30 years after increasing during the 1980s in line with increased deforestation 99,100 , despite climate change. Instead, an important feature of tropical deforestation fires is the strong interannual variation in step with drought cycles, such as those caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation 101,102 (Fig. 3i,j) . 



Landscape-wide conversions from slow-growing, infrequently burned forests to frequently burned grassland and shrublands are possible (Fig. 5) , which depletes soil carbon stores, as in regrowth forests in the conifer forests in the western USA 133 and in Indonesia 134 . This feedback process is most likely self-correcting because fire regimes will shift from being flammability-limited to fuel-limited with increasing
reduced productivity 40,42,133

The use of ‘planetary-scale’ tipping point suggests to us and to Brook et al. [2] synchronous or near-synchronous tipping on a global scale. Hughes et al. [3] concede this ‘is very unlikely’ for the terrestrial biosphere, yet they persevere with the term when describing nonsynchronous cascades of smaller-scale tipping points that ultimately add up to global effects. Here, the critical uncertainty is whether the causal coupling between different tipping events is of the sign and strength necessary to produce a global tipping cascade (e.g., Figure 1, main text @Miller2019

La perturbacion se puede definir por su indeterminación o imprevisibilidad desde dentro de las entidades que son aptas para acumular información y sufren dicha perturbación. Pero las perturbaciones que se repiten muy frecuentemente son internalizadas y la capacidad de anticiparlas se convierte en condicion de vida de los mismos organismos. (pag. 29)

@Grimm2012 Pattern-oriented modelling: a “multi-scope” for predictive systems ecology. 

Statistical physicists have used very abstract models to explain this distribution, linking it to the theory of ‘self-organized criticality’ (SOC): systems can organize themselves into a state characterized by self-similarity and, hence, a power law in the size frequency distribution of disturbance events. The classical model in this field includes a grid of cells that can be empty or contain a tree [41]. Cells are subject to lightning strikes which, if they hit a tree, spark a fire. Fire spreads deterministically to neighbouring cells with trees and destroys the trees. New trees emerge stochastically on empty grid cells. In contrast, generic wildfire models from ecology assume that fire spread is stochastic, that the flammability of a grid cell depends on the time since the cell burn the last time, and that succession and, hence, the local increase of flammability is deterministic [42,43].

Thus, these two types of model seem completely different: deterministic fires and stochastic regrowth of vegetation in the physicists’ model, stochastic fires and deterministic regrowth in the ecologists’ models. The advantage of the physicists’ model is that many of its features can be deduced analytically, whereas the
patterns is a ‘memory effect’: flammability increases with the time since a site last burned. In particular, Ratz [42] showed that his model not only reproduces the key power-law pattern, but also two additional patterns: the typical size and shape of unburned ‘forest islands’ within burnt areas, and a hump-shaped relationship between disturbance intensity (average annual area burned) and diversity of successional stages (figure 2).

Zinck & Grimm showed that these two additional patterns are also produced by the physicists’ model if grid cells represent entire tree stands of several hectares instead of individual trees [35,44]. They also showed that the key process for reproducing all three patterns is a ‘memory effect’: flammability increases
with the time since a site last burned. Interestingly, this unified model did not reproduce a fourth pattern: that the slope of fire size distributions observed in different ecoregions varies between -1.9 and -1.3. The unified model instead consistently produces a slope of -1.5. This failure indicated that the true generative mechanisms underlying wildfire regimes were not yet fully captured.


In subsequent work, Zinck et al. [45] found that the fire models’ assumption that fire spread is controlled only by fuel availability produces the unrealistic results. Fire spread is also affected by soil moisture, topography, species composition and other regional factors. A parameter for average spread success controls the slope of fire size distributions and the qualitative characteristics of fire regimes, and even separates two quantitatively and qualitatively distinct fire regimes. Thus, environmental changes can induce a sudden change in the characteristics of a forest system, a result that cannot be produced by the SOC models.

Fire spread is not just a function of weather, but also of topography, fuel load, types
and spatial arrangement, and active suppression. Therefore, the main fire spread simulation
models for everyday fire management require an enormous amount of site-specific informa-
tion (Perry 1998). Such models have been used in the context of climate change forecasting
(Fried et al. 2004). However, the spatial and temporal scale involved in this field frequently
makes this approach impractical, as (i) the computational effort is overwhelming, (ii) the
required local information is not available in large areas of the globe, and (iii) local details
may readily change over time. Therefore, many published reports on the effect of climate
change on wildland fire give forecasts of the evolution of some given atmospheric variables
or combinations of atmospheric variables that are particularly relevant to fire spread, but do
not translate these variables into fire features (Stocks et al. 1998; Flannigan et al. 1998, 2000;
Brown et al. 2004).

One advantage of minimal models, due to their level of
abstraction, is that they may apply across different systems,
and this leads us to the development of the model we
present here.

@Furlaud2021 - Bioclimatic drivers of fire severity across the Australian geographical range of giant Eucalyptus forests


Overall, our results indicate that climatic constraints on fire weather and fuel availability, not fuel load, are the key drivers of fire severity in these forests, which has been the general consensus on TWEF (Cawson et al., 2020).

While combustion of the live understorey is a key predictor of fire severity, the flammability of these live plants is primarily governed by fuel moisture and hence climate (Nolan et al., 2016). Extrinsic factors (such as climate and fire weather) have been well documented to play a dominant role in determining fire severity when compared to intrinsic factors (such as fuel load and arrangement), both in TWEF (Bowman et al., 2016) and in Eucalyptus forests more broadly (Penman et al., 2013; Price & Bradstock, 2011). This suggests these systems are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and given an increased likelihood of high-severity fire in a warming climate, need to be managed to reduce this likelihood and make these forests more resilient. This can be achieved by greater recognition of the ecological role of low-severity fires in these ecosystems.

The PMB paradigm is based on the assumption that the biotas of fire-prone biomes have finely tuned responses to a wide range of specific fire regimes. This assumption has recently been challenged on the basis that much variation in fire regimes appears to have no ecological significance; indeed, in highly fire-prone ecosystems, the biota is so resilient that differences are often only evident between strongly contrasting regimes (Parr & Andersen 2006; Davies et al. 2012). It has been suggested that the level of pyrodiversity required to maintain biodiversity might actually be very low (Andersen et al. 2005).
