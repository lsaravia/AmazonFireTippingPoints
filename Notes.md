## Abstract

Global tipping points in forest wildfires

Saravia L. A.,  Ben Bond-Lamberty, Samir Suweis, Solé R. 

## Cover

This study uses a simple forest-fire model and remote sensing data to examine the possible changes in the Amazon region's fire regime that depend on climate change-related variables. The findings of this research suggest that there are two possible regime changes: a critical regime that implies high variability in fire extension and mega-fires, and an absorbing phase transition that could lead to the extinction of the forest and a transition to a different vegetation state. The study predicts a consistent increase in fire extension in the Amazon region, but not a change in the fire-regime. The significance of this study lies in the fact that it provides important insights into the potential impacts of climate change on the Amazon forest, one of the most biodiverse and ecologically important regions on the planet. These findings are crucial for policymakers and environmental scientists working towards sustainable forest management and conservation in the face of ongoing climate change and human activities.

## Significance statement

I believe that Oikos is a Journal that publishes interdisciplinary research that is difficult to publish in more traditional-minded ecological journals. This manuscript is based on a simple forest-fire model applied to different systems, from brain dynamics to precipitation, and natural forest fires. We added modifications to the model that allow us to make predictions based on environmental variables estimated with General Circulation Models (GCM) of global change.  This model is potentially applicable to different ecosystems and of broad interest to the ecological sciences.

@NatureEcoEvo2020 Biodiversity in flames

Fires burn and spread because of current weather conditions and because of the quantity, distribution and dryness of fuel, which are determined by interactions between climate and forest ecology. While limited fires can have positive consequences for biodiversity, the effect of those at the scale currently being experienced is catastrophic, both for species and for ecosystems. This season has seen record-breaking temperatures in eastern Australia, which provide the conditions for fire ignition and spread. There is no doubt that such conditions will become more frequent and that new records will soon be set, and that this is the result of anthropogenic climate change.

@Shvidenko2013

One should expect considerably higher risks by the end of the century if the warming surpasses certain limits. The change in the amount of precipitation in summer will not offset the temperature increase, which will accelerate water stress for trees on the larger part of Russia. In this case, the most probable scenario for boreal forests would consist in the nonlinear response of forest ecosystems, which may lead to the creation of new ecosystems and the disappearance of species with limited adaptation capacity. According to the models and expert assessments, the regional warming by 6–7°C will mean the critical limits in functioning of boreal forest ecosystems will be reached. If these limits are surpassed, this will result in a massive dieback of trees. If the threshold values of resilience are overpassed, this process will be rather quick and a considerable transformation of boreal forests may take place in 50 years.

In Australia, it is difficult to disaggregate the influences of climate change from the effects of the cessation of >45,000 years of Aboriginal hunter-gatherer fire management following European colonization in the early nineteenth century 86,87 . However, the effect of climate change is becoming apparent in the increasing numbers of extreme fire events 24,88,8Most recently, a globally anomalous 2019–2020 fire season in Australia burned over 5 million ha of Eucalyptus forests 93 and has been linked with anthropogenic climate change 93,94 . 

Moreover, tropical deforestation fires have remained relatively constant over the last 30 years after increasing during the 1980s in line with increased deforestation 99,100 , despite climate change. Instead, an important feature of tropical deforestation fires is the strong interannual variation in step with drought cycles, such as those caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation 101,102 (Fig. 3i,j) . 


Landscape-wide conversions from slow-growing, infrequently burned forests to frequently burned grassland and shrublands are possible (Fig. 5) , which depletes soil carbon stores, as in regrowth forests in the conifer forests in the western USA 133 and in Indonesia 134 . This feedback process is most likely self-correcting because fire regimes will shift from being flammability-limited to fuel-limited with increasing reduced productivity 40,42,133

However, the relationship between vegetation fire and vegetation is likely to change in the future due to dynamic feedbacks, which is not accounted for using statistical associations 108,119,120 .

Another key area of uncertainty in future fire-regime predictions is the range of variability and frequency of extreme fire events, and there is a lack of research projecting these events and linking them to cascading consequences, such as post-fire floods, large-scale erosion and debris flows that alter hydrology and topography, and development of pyrocumulonimbus 136 . The paucity of projections is partially due to the substantial challenges and uncertainties inherent in coupling interdisciplinary models, as well as the increased level of uncertainty and error at the extremes 90,137,138 .

The use of ‘planetary-scale’ tipping point suggests to us and to Brook et al. [2] synchronous or near-synchronous tipping on a global scale. Hughes et al. [3] concede this ‘is very unlikely’ for the terrestrial biosphere, yet they persevere with the term when describing nonsynchronous cascades of smaller-scale tipping points that ultimately add up to global effects. Here, the critical uncertainty is whether the causal coupling between different tipping events is of the sign and strength necessary to produce a global tipping cascade (e.g., Figure 1, main text @Miller2019

@Grimm2012 Pattern-oriented modelling: a “multi-scope” for predictive systems ecology. 

Statistical physicists have used very abstract models to explain this distribution, linking it to the theory of ‘self-organized criticality’ (SOC): systems can organize themselves into a state characterized by self-similarity and, hence, a power law in the size frequency distribution of disturbance events. The classical model in this field includes a grid of cells that can be empty or contain a tree [41]. Cells are subject to lightning strikes which, if they hit a tree, spark a fire. Fire spreads deterministically to neighbouring cells with trees and destroys the trees. New trees emerge stochastically on empty grid cells. In contrast, generic wildfire models from ecology assume that fire spread is stochastic, that the flammability of a grid cell depends on the time since the cell burn the last time, and that succession and, hence, the local increase of flammability is deterministic [42,43].

Thus, these two types of model seem completely different: deterministic fires and stochastic regrowth of vegetation in the physicists’ model, stochastic fires and deterministic regrowth in the ecologists’ models. The advantage of the physicists’ model is that many of its features can be deduced analytically, whereas the
patterns is a ‘memory effect’: flammability increases with the time since a site last burned. In particular, Ratz [42] showed that his model not only reproduces the key power-law pattern, but also two additional patterns: the typical size and shape of unburned ‘forest islands’ within burnt areas, and a hump-shaped relationship between disturbance intensity (average annual area burned) and diversity of successional stages (figure 2).

Zinck & Grimm showed that these two additional patterns are also produced by the physicists’ model if grid cells represent entire tree stands of several hectares instead of individual trees [35,44]. They also showed that the key process for reproducing all three patterns is a ‘memory effect’: flammability increases
with the time since a site last burned. Interestingly, this unified model did not reproduce a fourth pattern: that the slope of fire size distributions observed in different ecoregions varies between -1.9 and -1.3. The unified model instead consistently produces a slope of -1.5. This failure indicated that the true generative mechanisms underlying wildfire regimes were not yet fully captured.


In subsequent work, Zinck et al. [45] found that the fire models’ assumption that fire spread is controlled only by fuel availability produces the unrealistic results. Fire spread is also affected by soil moisture, topography, species composition and other regional factors. A parameter for average spread success controls the slope of fire size distributions and the qualitative characteristics of fire regimes, and even separates two quantitatively and qualitatively distinct fire regimes. Thus, environmental changes can induce a sudden change in the characteristics of a forest system, a result that cannot be produced by the SOC models.

@Pueyo2007a

Fire spread is not just a function of weather, but also of topography, fuel load, types
and spatial arrangement, and active suppression. Therefore, the main fire spread simulation
models for everyday fire management require an enormous amount of site-specific informa-
tion (Perry 1998). Such models have been used in the context of climate change forecasting
(Fried et al. 2004). However, the spatial and temporal scale involved in this field frequently
makes this approach impractical, as (i) the computational effort is overwhelming, (ii) the
required local information is not available in large areas of the globe, and (iii) local details
may readily change over time. Therefore, many published reports on the effect of climate
change on wildland fire give forecasts of the evolution of some given atmospheric variables
or combinations of atmospheric variables that are particularly relevant to fire spread, but do
not translate these variables into fire features (Stocks et al. 1998; Flannigan et al. 1998, 2000;
Brown et al. 2004).

@Furlaud2021 - Bioclimatic drivers of fire severity across the Australian geographical range of giant Eucalyptus forests


Overall, our results indicate that climatic constraints on fire weather and fuel availability, not fuel load, are the key drivers of fire severity in these forests, which has been the general consensus on TWEF (Cawson et al., 2020).

While combustion of the live understorey is a key predictor of fire severity, the flammability of these live plants is primarily governed by fuel moisture and hence climate (Nolan et al., 2016). Extrinsic factors (such as climate and fire weather) have been well documented to play a dominant role in determining fire severity when compared to intrinsic factors (such as fuel load and arrangement), both in TWEF (Bowman et al., 2016) and in Eucalyptus forests more broadly (Penman et al., 2013; Price & Bradstock, 2011). This suggests these systems are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and given an increased likelihood of high-severity fire in a warming climate, need to be managed to reduce this likelihood and make these forests more resilient. This can be achieved by greater recognition of the ecological role of low-severity fires in these ecosystems.

@Andersen2014


The PMB paradigm is based on the assumption that the biotas of fire-prone biomes have finely tuned responses to a wide range of specific fire regimes. This assumption has recently been challenged on the basis that much variation in fire regimes appears to have no ecological significance; indeed, in highly fire-prone ecosystems, the biota is so resilient that differences are often only evident between strongly contrasting regimes (Parr & Andersen 2006; Davies et al. 2012). It has been suggested that the level of pyrodiversity required to maintain biodiversity might actually be very low (Andersen et al. 2005).

@Brando2019a

Surface tropical fires are expected to kill mostly small‐ and medium‐ sized trees, because the larger, thicker barked individuals can avoid heat‐related damage to cambium cells during fires (Brando et al., 2012). Although delayed postfire mortality of large trees has been observed across the tropics, the mechanisms driving this process remain unclear (Barlow et al., 2003). In our study, the persistent postfire mortality of large trees may have been associated with their increased vulnerability to windstorms.

Specifically, the fires weakened trunks and increased crown exposure of large trees to strong winds that impacted the experimental forest (Silvério et al., 2019). This postfire disturbance caused greater losses in canopy cover and biomass in areas impacted by our experimental fires. The observed rapid growth of resprouts and saplings was expected to partially re‐store forest structure (Chazdon et al., 2007), but ABG reached its lowest levels 7 years after the experimental fires had ended, particu‐
larly along the forest edges. Our results suggest that fragmentation of tropical forests—and the associated increase in forest edges— could dramatically increase the negative impacts of fires and lead to persistent losses of biomass (Silva et al., 2018). This is particularly true where fires co‐occur with extreme droughts that can further increase fire intensity and fire‐related tree mortality by triggering accumulation and desiccation of fuels (Aragão et al., 2008). A permanent transition to a new, derived‐savanna state in this ecotone would require persistence of grass cover and a more open canopy. While grasses could persist along the forest edges due to delayed postfire tree mortality (Higgins, Bond, & Trollope, 2000), we instead observed widespread postfire resprouting of woody vegetation—including in areas that had been previously covered by grasses. However, the total area occupied by grasses did not decrease, because grasses invaded new areas between 2012 and 2015. Furthermore, we found no major replacement of C4 by C3 species, a process expected to occur as light in the understory of the burned plots became scarce. Instead, light‐demanding African C4 grasses became more abundant, particularly where fires in previous years had been more intense and severe, and where the blowdown event had topkilled more trees (e.g., B3yr). The delayed tree mortality drove much of this process by increasing light and probably water availability as canopy cover decreased. Another likely driver was the greater capacity of African grasses to produce, germinate, and disperse seeds compared with the Cerrado native grasses (Higgins et al., 2000). These results raise the question of whether the edge of

Modeling work—based largely on simple models of tree populations interacting with mean-field approximations of critical behaviors in fire spread—suggests that the threshold response of fire spread to fuel-layer continuity could provide a plausible mechanism for maintaining the bistability of savanna and forest (Beckage and Ellingwood 2008; Beckage et al. 2009; Staver et al. 2011a; Staver and Levin 2012). Although empirically well supported (Archibald et al. 2009; Pueyo and Alen- castro Graa 2010), these modeling efforts have largely neglected to explicitly take into account the spatial dynamics of fire spread. This omission of the spatial dynamics of fire spread and of tree demography is problematic for two main reasons. Firstly, mean-field models cannot address the possibility, clearly recognized in the theoretical literature, that spatial dynamics may qualitatively change the stability characteristics of dynamical systems (Durrett and Levin 1994; Levin and Durrett 1996). Secondly, they can provide few insights into how local, spatial interactions mechanistically give rise to emergent patterns in fire spread (Archibald et al. 2009; Pueyo and Alencastro Graa 2010) and how these determine tree demographic responses to fire (Staver and Levin 2012). Percolation (Grimmett 1999) and, more generally, nearest-neighbor infection models (Archibald et al. 2012) make useful predictions about the threshold responses of fire regimes to fuel layer connectivity that emerge both locally and at the continental scale (Archibald et al. 2009; Pueyo and Alencastro Graa 2010; Staver et al. 2011a,b). However, although fire spread modeling in static landscapes can be fairly sophisticated (Sullivan 2009; Zinck and Grimm 2009), fully understanding the role of fire as an ecological process that emerges from and determines grass and tree cover in savanna remains an ongoing challenge.


Previous analytical models have tended to assume that, if fire spreads in a landscape, it affects the entire landscape, when in fact fire only affects those areas where it can propagate. This may lead to significant spatial structure in landscapes (Hochberg et al. 1994)

Approximately 38% of the burned forest was subsequently deforested, which represents 19% of the total area deforested during the period of analysis (Table 3, Fig. 7B). Although this rate was higher for the forest areas that were burned twice (45%), it was similar to the areas that burned three or four times during this period (averages of 41% and 35%, respectively), while decreasing in the forest areas that burned more than ﬁve times (,20%; Table 2). These results suggest a weak relation-
ship between ﬁre frequency and the likelihood of a forest being cleared in this region.

In 2010, the Amazon experienced another drought (36), with widespread understory forest fires that affected 5.4% of the Xingu region (Fig. S10). These extensive fires occurred even as deforestation declined (Table S2), suggesting that weather may have overwhelmed the expected inhibitory effect (on forest fires) of reducing the fire ignition sources that often accompany deforestation.

The reason for choosing this ﬁre model form is that ﬁre percolates through
space such that ﬁres occurring on separate discretized spatial units cannot be

causes of extra forest loss next to direct deforestation/logging 26–29 .

@Aragao2018 21st Century drought-related fires counteract the decline of Amazon deforestation carbon emissions

Most Earth System Models (ESMs) predict increasing dry season intensity in Amazonia in the 21st century. This is directly related to radiative
forcing 11 and declining Northern Hemisphere aerosol production 12, 13 , which tend to cause anomalous variation of sea surface temperatures (SST) and consequently drive large-scale swings in precipitation over Amazonia. If this new climatic conﬁguration is borne out, Amazonia is expected to become an ampliﬁed ﬁre-prone system 14, 15 , with emissions from drought-induced ﬁres unrelated to deforestation increasingly playing a much larger role than those from deforestation 15 .


Our analysis of SSTA showed that the two strongest droughts in
this century, occurring in 2005 and 2010, were strongly correlated
with the anomalous warming of the Atlantic ocean captured by
the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) 19, 20 index
(Fig. 1a–e). In contrast, the 2015 drought occurred following a
simultaneous development of anomalous warming of the equa-
torial and eastern tropical north Paciﬁc and tropical north
Atlantic oceans, as measured by the Multivariate El Nino Index
(MEI) 21 , the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation (PDO) 22 and the
AMO 19, 20

Currently, peaks in active ﬁre detection are more strongly
related to extreme drought events than to deforestation, as used to
be the case 5
This is conﬁrmed by the progressive temporal
decoupling between ﬁre occurrence and deforestation activities 31 .
Deforestation is clearly losing its explanatory power over the
variance of the absolute number of ﬁre detections, with this

The observed disassociation between deforestation and active
ﬁre incidence can be related to increased ﬁre incidence in either
(i) already deforested land covered by pastures (with no net
impact on the atmospheric C burden) or (ii) forested areas
dominated by woody vegetation. Our analysis showing that the
amount of CO emitted per ﬁre count is temporally stable indi-
cates that it is unlikely that C emissions are primarily related to
ﬁres in pastures. This is supported by the fact that a shift in
dominance from deforestation ﬁres to pasture ﬁres, through time,
would lead to a reduction in the CO concentration per ﬁre count.

@Pivello2021

Humid tropical forests, dominant in the Amazon basin and in the Atlantic Forest, present no indication of evolutionary history inﬂuenced by ﬁre, and their species do not have adaptations that favor their resistance to and resilience after ﬁre events. Outside extreme climate events, rainforests are rarely affected by naturally lit ﬁre, as high humidity levels and lack of fuel prevent ﬁre from starting and propagating. The natural ﬁre return intervals in these forests are estimated to be of hundreds or even thousands of years (Kauffmann and Uhl, 1990). However, extreme droughts increase the probability of forest ﬁres.

@Sanderson2020

The complex dynamics of fuel accumulation, vegetation dynamics and their interactions with climate under transient CO2 concentrations, as well as impacts of land management and human ignitions, are likely to result in fire behaviour patterns not represented in historical records. Thus, fire prediction over decadal to century timescales requires more mechanistic approaches, capable of capturing the numerous interacting system components that affect the evolution of fire risk 14 15.

Precipitation projections for southeast Australia remain highly uncertain and model-dependent 10 , and assessing the changing probabilities of low-rainfall years like 2019 under climate change requires large ensembles that simulate many realizations of natural variability 20 .

We are of course just repeating the original hope of SOC research and suggesting that systems of entirely different nature may indeed exhibit similar emergent collective behavior, even if the dynamics does not operate in a critical state, but rather is found to inhabit a broad region of approximately scale-free nature. Crucial for our suggestion is the observation that the true asymptotic behavior of the FFM appears to happen for such enormous systems sizes that they hardly are of relevance to real macroscopic systems.

We estimate changes in forest cover (deforestation and forest regrowth) in the tropics for the two last decades (1990–2000 and 2000–2010) based on a sample of 4000 units of 10 ×10 km size. Forest cover is interpreted from satellite imagery at 30 × 30 m resolution. Forest cover changes are then combined with pan-tropical biomass maps to estimate carbon losses. We show that there was a gross loss of tropical forests of 8.0 million ha yr−1 in the 1990s and 7.6 million ha yr−1 in the 2000s (0.49% annual rate), with no statistically significant difference. Humid forests account for 64% of the total forest cover in 2010 and 54% of the net forest loss during second study decade

@Fonseca2019

Considering all four RCPs and using the outputs of the Earth system model HadGEM2‐ES, Betts et al. (2015) found an increase in the meteorologically defined forest fire danger index (FFDI) in the Amazon during the 21st century, with greater increases at higher levels of global warming. The authors warned, however, that the FFDI provides an indication of the effects of simulated changes in weather conditions for the risk of fire, but should not be understood as the fire activity per se since the latter is largely dependent on the susceptibility of the landscape to fire and on the influence of humans on either ignition or fire suppression.

In the Brazilian Amazon, fire is almost entirely human‐ignited, given that it usually occurs in the driest period of the year and that lightning in the region is usually accompanied by rain, reducing the chance of igniting a natural fire (Barbosa & Fearnside, 2005). Deforestation and subsequent agricultural activities have increased the anthropogenic ignition sources in the last 40 years, since fire is the main technique used to clear the land and to renew pasture areas (Aragão et al., 2014). Although annual deforestation has sharply decreased from 27,772 km 2 in 2004 to 4,571 km 2 in 2012, it has been fluctuating since then, showing annual variation from −15% up to +29% (INPE, 2017a). Large‐scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects, the continuous weakening of environmental and indigenous protection agencies, relaxation of environmental legislation, including reduction of requirements in the environmental licensing process of potentially harmful enterprises, are some of the current threats that raise serious concerns about the future deforestation rates (Aguiar et al., 2016; Fearnside, 2016; Tollefson, 2018). Additionally, secondary vegetation regrowth on previously cleared areas is highly fire‐prone given its low and open canopy (Ray, Nepstad, & Moutinho, 2005), mostly in its early regeneration stages and during dry years (Gutiérrez‐Velez et al., 2014). Repeated clearing and burning of vegetation regrowth is a widespread practice in the Brazilian Amazon (Neeff, Lucas, Santos, Brondizio, & Freitas, 2006; Zarin et al., 2005), increasing the ignition sources.

However, continued degradation and loss of forest cover and biodiver-
sity therein could undermine ecosystem resilience and hasten an irre-
versible tipping point 12 . Indeed, a loss of 20–25% of Amazonian forests
could precipitate a rapid transition to savannah-like formations 13,14 .

Since the 1960s, approximately 20% of Amazonian forest cover has
been lost as a result of deforestation and fires 15 . Forest loss is predicted
to reach 21–40% by 2050, and such habitat loss will have large impacts on Amazonian biodiversity 16,17 .

The MODIS
burned area product detects the approximate date of burning by locat-
ing the occurrence of rapid changes in daily surface reflectance time
series data. We also obtained the monthly active fire location product
(MCD14ML) from the University of Maryland (https://modis-fire.umd.
edu/). The MODIS active fire product detects land surface thermal
anomalies at the time of satellite overpass under relatively cloud-free
conditions using a contextual algorithm. We used vegetation fire with
high detection confidence (>80%) to avoid false or minor fire signals,
and converted the fire locations into monthly 927-m (or 1-km) raster
layers 54 .


In conjunction with ongoing habitat loss
due to deforestation, increasing fires in the Amazon potentially pose
another great threat to biodiversity 4 : because Amazonian species have
largely evolved in the absence of fire, they generally lack adaptations to
fire-related damage (ref. 18 and references therein). Fires associated with
deforestation generally lead to a total loss of forest habitat 3 , and the burn-
ing of felled vegetation impairs regeneration and facilitates the invasion
of exotic grasses 19 . Forest fires also have largely negative impacts on the
habitats and long-term fitness of species due to habitat degradation 20–22 .
Repeated burning can result in considerable species loss and turnover 23,24 .
Burning can also initiate a series of positive feedbacks, including increases
in dry fuel loads and midday temperatures, desiccation of biomass and
flammability of native forests at the edges of clearings 25

A link between the behavior observed in brain activity and
rainfalls [6, 7] and the Forest Fire Model was already suggested
in [10]. Inspired by these studies, we analyse in detail the
residence time distribution (which corresponds to the tree
density distribution in the FFM) and its relationship to the order
parameters used in standard percolation [11] and the brain study
[6], namely the average cluster size and the normalized size of
the largest cluster. We find that there is indeed a critical-like
region where the fluctuations peak up and where the system
seems to spend most of the time, exactly like in the brain and rain
observations.

Even though the studies of precipitation [7] and brain activity
[6] related their findings to critical behavior, both observed a
remarkable broad onset of the order parameter, which is certainly
not the behavior seen as one approaches the critical point of a
second-order phase transition of an infinite system. The absence
of a sharp onset of the order parameter is remarkable because,
for system sizes like the earth atmosphere or the human brain,
one would not expect any significant finite-size effect if the
usual phenomenology of equilibrium phase transitions were
any guidance.


Although we had to restrict our simulations to values of θ <
10 4 , we observe a very robust scaling for the largest cluster 3,
which is not observed in the distribution of cluster sizes P(S) over
the same range of θ [4]. Interestingly, we found that h3i ∼ θ 1.04 ,
a super-linear growth which indicates that the correlations in

The present paper focuses on the effect of fine-grained heterogeneity in the
environment. In the RS model, we place small obstacles onto the slope, and ask the following
questions.
1) How does the abundance and penetrability of the obstacles influence the range
edge?
2) Are the scaling laws detected in snapshots also applicable in the long run, for
the averages of occupancies?
We show that the scaling laws are broadly applicable. Accordingly, we propose that the
geographic distributions of species should be delineated at the hull in order to monitor range
shifts reliably.

Tropical forest fires are ignited almost entirely via accidental ignition or by people clearing veg-
etation, burning agricultural fields and pastureland, or committing arson. Active frontier zones
and the transportation networks within them are a major hub of fire activity (Nepstad et al. 1999,
Schroeder et al. 2009). Anthropogenic ignitions are increasingly prevalent in vast portions of trop-
ical forests undergoing extensive land-use and land-cover change. Most human activities in the
Amazon region started during the 1980s, when large tracts of forest were converted to agricul-
tural fields. In general, instances of lightning-ignited wildfires in closed-canopy forests are much


During the Amazon drought in 2010, for example, Gatti et al. (2014) estimated a net flux of 0.2 PgC from the basin, compared with non-drought years.

Currently, anthropogenic climate change is altering precipitation patterns and increasing temperatures, resulting in more
frequent extreme vegetation-fire events 23–25 .

@Soares-filho2006. Modelling conservation in the Amazon basin

By 2050, current trends in agricultural expansion will eliminate a total of 40% of Amazon forests

We estimate that the closed-canopy forest formation of the Amazon will be reduced from its current area of 5.3 million km 2 (2003, 85% of the original area) to 3.2 million km 2 (53%) by 2050 if current trends continue unabated (BAU = ‘business-as-usual’)

The model, which we call ‘SimAmazonia 1’ (from the Portuguese simulação da Amazônia) produces annual maps of simulated future deforestation under user- defined scenarios of highway paving, PA networks, PA effectiveness, deforestation rates and deforested land ceilings.

@Brando2019. Droughts, Wildfires, and Forest Carbon Cycling: A Pantropical Synthesis

Tropical forest fires are ignited almost entirely via accidental ignition or by people clearing veg-
etation, burning agricultural fields and pastureland, or committing arson. Active frontier zones
and the transportation networks within them are a major hub of fire activity

Even in areas with low deforestation rates, land management practices in previously cleared areas often involve fire,
which can readily spread to nearby forests. This spread of wildfire into adjacent forest areas is well
documented in the satellite record (Aragão & Shimabukuro 2010).
Land-use and land-cover changes also fundamentally alter fuels and the microclimate at forest
edges. After decades of widespread deforestation, nearly 20% of remaining tropical forests lie
within 100 m of a forest edge (Brando et al. 2014, Brinck et al. 2017, Haddad et al. 2017). Forest
edges allow for greater sunlight and wind penetration, higher air temperatures, increased VPD,
and lower soil moisture and relative humidity (Laurance 2000)—resulting in very dry accumulated
fuels. Native and non-native grasses, often introduced at forest edges, can provide even greater
amounts of fine fuels that readily burn (Silverio et al. 2013, Nepstad et al. 2004). Overall, the
land-use change effects—increased ignitions, greater fuels, and drier conditions—interact with
drought conditions to increase the likelihood of fire occurrence in tropical forests (Aragão et al.
2018, Chen et al. 2017).

Projections of climate change in the
future indicate that there will be an increase in precipitation in the rainy
season and a decrease in the dry season. It is also predicted that the
temperature will rise constantly during the dry seasons (Oo et al., 2019).
The combined effect of higher temperature and dryer conditions exceeds
the limits of tolerance of many Amazon trees, resulting in mortality
(Phillips et al., 2009). The expected increase in severe droughts in the
Amazon makes it urgent to understand their potential impacts on
forests.

A fire that occurs in a specific year is detected in the subsequent year
because there can be a delay of up to one year for the burn scar to be
detectable on satellite images. Thus, a burn scar mapped at time (t + 1)
is attributed to the previous year (t) in order to represent the real year of
the fire (Vasconcelos et al., 2013).

@Aragao2018

Our results emphasize the fact that in a hotter and drier future, large swaths of the Amazon, distant from the main deforestation epicentres, may burn.

Currently, peaks in active ﬁre detection are more strongly related to extreme drought events than to deforestation, as used to be the case 5 . This is conﬁrmed by the progressive temporal decoupling between ﬁre occurrence and deforestation activities 31 . Deforestation is clearly losing its explanatory power over the variance of the absolute number of ﬁre detections.

@Staver2012

Savannas with tree cover below ∼40% burn frequently, but fire is almost nonexistent in systems with tree cover above ∼40% (Hennenberg et al. 2006; Archibald et al. 2009; Pueyo et al. 2010; Staver et al. 2011b). This threshold appears to be universal, despite differences in the effects of forest versus savanna trees on the grass layer in their subcanopy. Thus, we assume athresholdresponseoffirefrequencytograssabundance: above a threshold in grass abundance (GT), fire spreads; below that threshold, it does not.

@Lenton2008

Amazon Rainforest. A large fraction of precipitation in the Amazon basin is recycled, and, therefore, simulations of Amazon deforestation typically generate 20–30% reductions in precipitation (78), lengthening of the dry season, and increases in summer temperatures (79) that would make it difficult for the forest to reestablish, and suggest the system may exhibit bistability. Dieback of the Amazon rainforest has been predicted (2, 80) to occur under 3–4°C global warming because of a more persistent El Nin ̃o state that leads to drying over much of the Amazon basin (81). Different vegetation models driven with similar climate projections also show Amazon dieback (82), but other global climate models (83) project smaller reductions (or increases) of precipitation and, therefore, do not produce dieback (84). A regional climate model (85) predicts Amazon dieback due to widespread reductions in precipitation and lengthening of the dry season. Changes in fire frequency probably contribute to bistability and will be amplified by forest fragmentation due to human activity. Indeed land-use change alone could potentially bring forest cover to a critical threshold. Thus, the fate of the Amazon may be determined by a complex interplay between direct land-use change and the response of regional precipitation and ENSO to global forcing

@vandeLeemput2016

Rather than aiming to be complete, ‘minimal models’ such as the one we present may help to understand how non-linear mechanisms may interact to drive complex systems.

@Koch2023

Simpler models based on equilibrium concepts, on the other hand, have long been assumed to be unsuitable to capture tree–grass interactions and have therefore traditionally received little attention (Jeltsch et al. 2000). In line with related models based on dynamical systems theory (Anderies et al. 2002, Van Langevelde et al. 2003, Accatino et al. 2010, Staver et al. 2011, Holdo et al. 2013, Touboul et al. 2018) we challenge this view by demonstrating that simple models can indeed contribute to an improved understanding of the forces that push savanna systems towards encroachment. We consider our model a proof of concept. It demonstrates that interaction networks and provide a powerful tool-set because they allow us to study the relative importance of the underlying feedback loops.
