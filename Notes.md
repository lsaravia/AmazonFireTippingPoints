# Notes




Fires burn and spread because of current weather conditions and because of the quantity, distribution and dryness of fuel, which are determined by interactions between climate and forest ecology. While limited fires can have positive consequences for biodiversity, the effect of those at the scale currently being experienced is catastrophic, both for species and for ecosystems. This season has seen record-breaking temperatures in eastern Australia, which provide the conditions for fire ignition and spread. There is no doubt that such conditions will become more frequent and that new records will soon be set, and that this is the result of anthropogenic climate change.

One should expect considerably higher risks by the end of the century if the warming surpasses certain limits. The change in the amount of precipitation in summer will not offset the temperature increase, which will accelerate water stress for trees on the larger part of Russia. In this case, the most probable scenario for boreal forests would consist in the nonlinear response of forest ecosystems, which may lead to the creation of new ecosystems and the disappearance of species with limited adaptation capacity. According to the models and expert assessments, the regional warming by 6–7°C will mean the critical limits in functioning of boreal forest ecosystems will be reached. If these limits are surpassed, this will result in a massive dieback of trees. If the threshold values of resilience are overpassed, this process will be rather quick and a considerable transformation of boreal forests may take place in 50 years.

In Australia, it is difficult to disaggregate the influences of climate change from the effects of the cessation of >45,000 years of Aboriginal hunter-​gatherer fire management following European colonization in the early nineteenth century 86,87 . However, the effect of climate change is becoming apparent in the increasing numbers of extreme fire events 24,88,89

Most recently, a globally anomalous 2019–2020 fire season in Australia burned over 5 million ha of Eucalyptus forests 93 and has been linked with anthropogenic climate change 93,94 .

Moreover, tropical deforestation fires have remained relatively constant over the last 30 years after increasing during the 1980s in line with increased deforestation 99,100 , despite climate change. Instead, an important feature of tropical deforestation fires is the strong interannual variation in step with drought cycles, such as those caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation 101,102 (Fig. 3i,j) .

The use of ‘planetary-scale’ tipping point suggests to us and to Brook et al. [2] synchronous or near-synchronous tipping on a global scale. Hughes et al. [3] concede this ‘is very unlikely’ for the terrestrial biosphere, yet they persevere with the term when describing nonsynchronous cascades of smaller-scale tipping points that ultimately add up to global effects. Here, the critical uncertainty is whether the causal coupling between different tipping events is of the sign and strength necessary to produce a global tipping cascade (e.g., Figure 1, main text).

La perturbacion se puede definir por su indeterminación o imprevisibilidad desde dentro de las entidades que son aptas para acumular información y sufren dicha perturbación. Pero las perturbaciones que se repiten muy frecuentemente son internalizadas y la capacidad de anticiparlas se convierte en condicion de vida de los mismos organismos. (pag. 29)

## Abstract

Global tipping points in forest wildfires

Saravia L. A.,  Ben Bond-Lamberty, Samir Suweis, Solé R. 

Fire is one of the most important disturbances of the earth-system, shaping the biodiversity of ecosystems and particularly forests. Anthropogenic drivers such as climatic change and other human activities could produce potentially abrupt changes in fire regimes, potentially triggering more profound transformations like the transition from forests to savannah, grasslands or desert ecosystems. Large biodiversity loss could be produced if these transitions occur. Two of the more important factors influencing fires are temperature and precipitation, and climatic change could cause conditions that enhance fire ignition and spread, which in turn will produce more extensive, intense, and frequent fires. Here we analyze the changes in fire regimes at subcontinental scales, including in regions defined as tipping elements of the earth system. We propose a unified fire model that includes the most basic characteristics needed to reproduce the observed fire dynamics in these regions. Considering IPCC climate projections for the 21st century, we evaluate the possible changes in these fire regimes and the expected changes in global forests.
